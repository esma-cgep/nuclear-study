# Scenarios

The following scenarios were considered in this study:
- **Reference** - reference costs of nuclear;
- **Moderate Nuclear** - investment, variable and fixed O&M costs of nuclear fall by 10% in 2030 and by 20% in 2050 compared to Reference;
- **Optimistic Nuclear** - investment, variable and fixed O&M costs of nuclear fall by 34% in 2030 and by 69% in 2050 compared to Reference;
- **ITC** - IRA's investment tax credit on nuclear technologies (only);
- **PTC** - IRA's production tax credit on nuclear technologies (only).

Additionally, the following variants were considered:
- _**default**_ - does not include any emission constraint;
- **NZE2035** - net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2035 in the power sector;
- **NZE2035** - net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 in the power sector;
- **CB** - power sector emissions are subject to a carbon budget.
